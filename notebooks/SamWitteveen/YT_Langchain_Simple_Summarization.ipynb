              "[Document(page_content='How This Book Was Written-And Why \\nby \\n\\nDale Carnegie \\n\\nDuring the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the \\npublishing houses of America printed more than a fifth of a million \\ndifferent books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were \\nfinancial failures. \"Many,\" did I say? The president of one of the \\nlargest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his \\ncompany, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost \\nmoney on seven out of every eight books it published. \\n\\nWhy, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after \\nI had written it, why should you bother to read it? \\n\\n\\nFair questions, both; and I\\'ll try to answer them. \\n\\n\\nI have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business \\nand professional men and women in New York. At first, I conducted \\ncourses in public speaking only - courses designed to train adults, by \\nactual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with \\nmore clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business \\ninterviews and before groups. \\n\\nBut gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as \\nthese adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still \\nmore training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday \\nbusiness and social contacts. \\n\\nI also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training \\nmyself. As I look back across the years, I am appalled at my own \\nfrequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such \\nas this had been placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a \\npriceless boon it would have been. \\n\\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face, \\nespecially if you are in business. Yes, and that is also true if you are \\na housewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few years ago \\nunder the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement \\nof Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact - a fact \\nlater confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute \\nof Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such \\ntechnical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one\\'s financial \\nsuccess is due to one\\'s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is \\ndue to skill in human engineering-to personality and the ability to \\nlead people. \\n\\nFor many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers\\' \\nClub of Philadelphia, and also courses for the New York Chapter of \\nthe American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of probably \\nmore than fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my \\nclasses. They came to me because they had finally realized, after \\nyears of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel \\nin engineering are frequently not those who know the most about \\nengineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in \\nengineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at \\nnominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus \\nthe ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse \\nenthusiasm among people-that person is headed for higher earning \\npower. \\n\\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that \"the ability \\nto deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or \\ncoffee.\" \"And I will pay more for that ability,\" said John D., \"than for \\nany other under the sun.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nWouldn\\'t you suppose that every college in the land would conduct \\ncourses to develop the highest-priced ability under the sun? But if \\nthere is just one practical, common-sense course of that kind given \\nfor adults in even one college in the land, it has escaped my \\nattention up to the present writing. \\n\\nThe University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted \\na survey to determine what adults want to study.', lookup_str='', metadata={}, lookup_index=0),\n",
              " Document(page_content='The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted \\na survey to determine what adults want to study. \\n\\nThat survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the \\nsurvey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a \\ntypical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and \\nrequested to answer 156 questions-questions such as \"What is your \\nbusiness or profession? Your education? How do you spend your \\nspare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? \\nYour problems? What subjects are you most interested in studying?\" \\nAnd so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of \\nadults and that their second interest is people; how to understand \\nand get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to \\nwin others to your way of thinking. \\n\\nSo the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a \\ncourse for adults in Meriden. They searched diligently for a practical \\ntextbook on the subject and found-not one. Finally they approached \\none of the world\\'s outstanding authorities on adult education and \\nasked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of this group. \\n\"No,\" he replied, \"I know what those adults want. But the book they \\nneed has never been written.\" \\n\\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself \\nhad been searching for years to discover a practical, working \\nhandbook on human relations. \\n\\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my \\nown courses. And here it is. I hope you like it. \\n\\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on \\nthe subject- everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles, \\nrecords of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and \\nthe new psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to \\nspend one and a half years in various libraries reading everything I \\nhad missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring \\nover hundreds of magazine articles, searching through countless \\nbiographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had \\ndealt with people. We read their biographies, We read the life stories \\nof all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison. I recall that \\nwe read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. \\nWe were determined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every \\npractical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the ages for \\nwinning friends and influencing people. \\n\\n\\n\\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them \\nworld-famous-inventors like Marconi and Edison; political leaders like \\nFranklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen \\nD. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford; and \\nexplorers like Martin Johnson-and tried to discover the techniques \\nthey used in human relations. \\n\\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it \"How to Win \\nFriends and Influence People.\" I say \"short.\" It was short in the \\nbeginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one \\nhour and thirty minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to \\nthe adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York. \\n\\nI gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their \\nbusiness and social contacts, and then come back to class and speak \\nabout their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an \\ninteresting assignment! These men and women, hungry for self- \\nimprovement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a new kind \\nof laboratory - the first and only laboratory of human relationships \\nfor adults that had ever existed. \\n\\nThis book wasn\\'t written in the usual sense of the word.

              " Document(page_content='This book wasn\\'t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a \\nchild grows. It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the \\nexperiences of thousands of adults. \\n\\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger \\nthan a postcard. The next season we printed a larger card, then a \\nleaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and \\nscope. After fifteen years of experiment and research came this \\nbook. \\n\\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or \\nguesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as it sounds, I have \\nseen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives \\nof many people. \\n\\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. \\nFor years, he had driven and criticized and condemned his \\nemployees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of \\nappreciation and encouragement were alien to his lips. After studying \\nthe principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply altered \\nhis philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new \\nloyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of team-work. Three hundred \\nand fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he \\nproudly said in a speech before the class: \"When I used to walk \\nthrough my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees \\nactually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But \\nnow they are all my friends and even the janitor calls me by my first \\nname.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and -what is infinitely \\nmore important-he found far more happiness in his business and in \\nhis home. \\n\\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales \\nby the use of these principles. Many have opened up new accounts - \\naccounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have \\nbeen given increased authority, increased pay. One executive \\nreported a large increase in salary because he applied these truths. \\nAnother, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was \\nslated for demotion when he was sixty-five because of his \\nbelligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This \\ntraining not only saved him from the demotion but brought him a \\npromotion with increased pay. \\n\\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at \\nthe end of the course have told me that their homes have been \\nmuch happier since their husbands or wives started this training. \\n\\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It \\nall seems like magic. In some cases, in their enthusiasm, they have \\ntelephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn\\'t wait \\nforty-eight hours to report their achievements at the regular session \\nof the course. \\n\\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far \\ninto the night discussing them with other members of the class. At \\nthree o\\'clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so \\nshaken by a realization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista \\nof a new and richer world opening before him, that he was unable to \\nsleep. He didn\\'t sleep that night or the next day or the next night. \\n\\nWho was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any \\nnew theory that came along? No, Far from it. He was a sophisticated, \\nblasM dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three \\nlanguages fluently and was a graduate of two European universities. \\n\\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the \\nold school, an aristocrat whose forebears had served for generations \\nas professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, \\nwritten from a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of \\nthese principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.', lookup_str='', metadata={}, lookup_index=0),\n",
